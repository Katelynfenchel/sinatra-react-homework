# sinatra-react-homework

1. Fork and Clone this repo.
2. Create a RESTful api for a model of your choosing in Sinatra.
3. Create a React Native Application that performs CRUD actions on that model.

Start by just creating a CR app (don't overwhelm yourself with UD). Once you tackle that, move on to adding the UD.
